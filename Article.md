# Attending prison programs does not keep incarcerated people from recidivating

#### The number of programs in which inmates participate during their incarceration has no effect on their chances to recidivate, our analysis has shown. Higher education and employment are some of the factors that contribute to lower recidivism rates, while gang affiliation is the factor most associated with rearrests. Race did not have any impact on recidivism.

Almost two out of every three individuals who are incarcerated in the United States are rearrested within the first three years after their release. This data, provided by the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/media/document/rpr34s125yfup1217.pdf?utm_content=rpr34s125yfup1217_tcdca21_tcus14st&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery), calls into question how effective the penitentiary system is in fulfilling what should be its main goal: rehabilitating individuals.

### Prison programs do not seem to affect recidivism

It does not matter if someone attends no programs at all during their time in prison or if they attend 9 programs: once they are released, they have the same likelihood to recidivate.

That is what our analysis of recidivism data in Georgia has found. Both, people in prison who did not attend any program, and those who attended 9 programs had a 59% chance of recidivating. We analyzed a dataset of 25000 individuals who were paroled in Georgia between December 2013 and January 2015. In this case, recidivism is defined as being rearrested for a felony or misdemeanor.

David Harding, a Sociology Professor at UC Berkeley specializing in incarceration and reentry, attributes this to the low quality of rehabilitation programs. “The reason many prisons run programs is to keep inmates busy so they are easier to manage,” says Harding. “Often, programs aren’t really well designed, they are mismatched to the person’s needs or are very hard to get into because there is a long waiting list. There is not enough of them” he added. Only those who attended 10 or more programs presented a smaller percentage of recidivism. 

Not tailoring the programs to the incarcerated people’s needs is one of the problems Divine Lipscomb, project coordinator for Restorative Justice Initiative, points out. Lipscomb, who was formerly incarcerated, says that **more voices of successful reentrants like himself are needed to design better rehabilitation programs**. “Often it is a group of white men who have never been to prison the ones designing these programs, and they don’t understand the needs of black and brown communities,” Lipscomb says. 

### College education is associated with lower recidivism

Higher education is one of the most effective ways to help imprisoned people successfully reenter society. Those who have some college education are 15% less likely to recidivate than their peers who do not.

**“Education is the one thing the system can never take away from you”**, Lipscomb was told during his incarceration, and it has never left his mind ever since. That is why he now advocates for the right of incarcerated people to be educated during their stay in prison and also once they are released. He is running programs such as Rising Scholars, which shows reentrants what studying at Penn State University would look like. 


According to Lipscomb, the importance of higher education is “the ability it gives to individuals to better understand society, their role in it, and how to advocate for themselves”. Apart from that, it also increases employability, one of the keys to rebuilding life after prison. Having a job at some point in the first three years of release meant having a 10% smaller chance to recidivate.

### Race does not affect recidivism at all

Unlike what [previous studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235210000796#:~:text=Results%20showed%20that%20race%20strongly,had%20significant%20effects%20on%20recidivism.) have shown, race did not have an effect on recidivism in Georgia. Black individuals were rearrested in 58.6% of the cases, while the percentage for white individuals was 56.3%.


[<img width="401" alt="Recidivism by race" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99926488/166611657-354094a4-b618-4642-8185-5afb60ab2d94.png">](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/9787264/)

In the United States, black people have a higher chance of being incarcerated and in Georgia, they are sent to prison at 2.8 times the rate of white individuals. Professor Harding explains that “incarceration is so much more common among blacks because of the way discrimination is heavily present in the criminal justice system”. [Studies](https://news.gsu.edu/research-magazine/spring2020/incarceration) have shown that black people are sentenced to more time in prison than whites who have committed the same crimes. This situation leads to black people being in prison for less severe crimes than their white counterparts.

Professor Harding explains that in his research, they found that **white inmates often have more mental health and substance abuse issues than blacks**. That was also the case in Georgia. “If you are white, your chances of getting incarcerated are lower. So you essentially have to be in a very bad situation to end up in prison” he said. These differences probably balance out the recidivism percentage, bringing it to a similar rate in both races.

For Divine Lipscomb, the problem lays also in education. “Schools in black neighborhoods often have fewer resources, kids experience institutional racism and have lower success rates”. In the long run, the educational differences end up accounting for the racial disparity in incarceration.

 ### Four out of five gang-affiliated individuals are rearrested

Gang affiliation is the most significant factor when looking at recidivism rates in Georgia: four out of five gang-affiliated individuals were rearrested. Lipscomb explains that internal rules and the way gangs operate make it almost impossible for their members to state out of prison. “If you do not want to go back, stay away from gangs” he said.

[<img width="397" alt="Recidivism by gang-affiliation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99926488/166577792-e56c8d6e-10d7-402e-a00f-f7db36c3e7f3.png">](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/9785152/)

Part of the increased number of arrests can be explained due to “more police surveillance and likelihood of getting arrested” explains Professor Harding while pointing out that police departments usually have closer monitoring of gang members. A [study](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/gang-affiliation-and-prisoner-reentry-discrete-time-variation) by the National Institute of Justice shows that former gang members were more likely to get arrested after release, however, they did not get convicted. But in the case of current gang members, they were more likely to get rearrested and reconvicted. This demonstrates the need for specific programs to address gang-related problems.
